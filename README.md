### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist/Data Engineer, looking to expand my practical skills while continuing to study math and theory on the side. I am particularly interested in machine learning, and am inspired by projects that marry technical complexity with positive social impact.

I'm currently seeking a job, so feel free to reach out to me at StevenBenBooth@gmail.com if this description sounds like it might be a match!
